* Ultimate Skewb
The ultimate skewb is a permutation puzzle. We will analyse it with gap.

** Subgroup
We will focus our attention first on a subgroup of the ultimate skewb. In
particular the subgroup generated by the left and right rotations.

#+BEGIN_SRC gap
lpbp := (1,2,3);
rpbp := (1,3,4);
#+END_SRC
